# PY-DOS
DOS-like "operating system" written in Python.

This is a project I'll be continuing to develop and add on to from September 5, 2025 (Initial commit) to at least June 2026 as I take computer science class this year and learn more as the year goes on. 

This project is a DOS-like Python script that aims to replicate the behavior of DOS systems from the 1980s and 1990s.

*This project is in alpha. Expect stuff to break, and feel free to report any bugs you find.*
